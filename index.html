		<div class="container">
			<h3>I</h3>
			Among twenty snowy mountains,<br>
			The only moving thing<br>
			Was the eye of the blackbird.
		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>II</h3>
			I was of three minds,<br>
			Like a tree<br>
			In which there are three blackbirds.
 		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>III</h3>
			The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.<br>
			It was a small part of the pantomime.
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>IV</h3>
			A man and a woman<br>
			Are one.<br>
			A man and a woman and a blackbird<br>
			Are one.
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>V</h3>
			I do not know which to prefer,<br>
			The beauty of inflections<br>
			Or the beauty of innuendoes,<br>
			The blackbird whistling<br>
			Or just after.
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>VI</h3>
			Icicles filled the long window<br>
			With barbaric glass.<br>
			The shadow of the blackbird<br>
			Crossed it, to and fro.<br>
			The mood<br>
			Traced in the shadow<br>
			An indecipherable cause.
		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>VII</h3>
			O thin men of Haddam,<br>
			Why do you imagine golden birds?<br>
			Do you not see how the blackbird<br>
			Walks around the feet<br>
			Of the women about you?
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>VIII</h3>
			I know noble accents<br>
			And lucclass, inescapable rhythms;<br>
			But I know, too,<br>
			That the blackbird is involved<br>
			In what I know.
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>IX</h3>
			When the blackbird flew out of sight,<br>
			It marked the edge<br>
			Of one of many circles.
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>X</h3>
			At the sight of blackbirds<br>
			Flying in a green light,<br>
			Even the bawds of euphony<br>
			Would cry out sharply.
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>XI</h3>
			He rode over Connecticut<br>
			In a glass coach.<br>
			Once, a fear pierced him,<br>
			In that he mistook<br>
			The shadow of his equipage<br>
			For blackbirds.
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>XII</h3>
			The river is moving.<br>
			The blackbird must be flying.
  		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>XIII</h3>
			It was evening all afternoon.<br>
			It was snowing<br>
			And it was going to snow.<br>
			The blackbird sat<br>
			In the cedar-limbs.
